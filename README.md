## This is my project report on Automating log analysis using machine learning algorithms

1. Abstract:
   Since AI / ML started evolving, it has been really helpful in resolving and handling complex task. Out of which one of the task is Long Review, Log Analysis, Root cause finding, Anomaly Detection, In fact my Focus is to Analysis the set of logs from larger number of Machines or Network of Machines to find out what is the root cause of the issue or to find the error and resolve the issue based on the findings, but to perform such an automation on logs is a very complex task and still an on going challenge. With this Abstract, I am offering the precise log analysis by Using Machine Learning and finding the root cause of the issue, Challenges, to examine the fundamental principles and further developments in this area.
